# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
The Proposed solution is implemented using Python with OpenCV and MobilenetV2, a convolutional neural network architecture. It aims to work a better in mobile phones. It is also known as MobilenetV2. It is a lightweight approach and also gives a good accuracy compared to other methods. This system works as a real time drowsiness detection model. Based on the threshold value in the output, the buzzer warning was to the drivers to detect the drowsy state of the driver.
