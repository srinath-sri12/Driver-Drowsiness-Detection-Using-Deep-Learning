# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
The Proposed solution is implemented using Python with OpenCV and MobilenetV2, a convolutional neural network architecture. It aims to work a better in mobile phones. It is also known as MobilenetV2. It is a lightweight approach and also gives a good accuracy compared to other methods. This system works as a real time drowsiness detection model. Based on the threshold value in the output, the buzzer warning was to the drivers to detect the drowsy state of the driver.  


#MODEL DESCRIPTION
    Train the data set to get a model. The data set is own video data set. It was collected from various resources. First the videos are converted into frames. From that frames the images are classified into respected work.
